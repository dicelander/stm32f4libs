ISD1820 recording module API
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This API contains functions to provide use of some hardware resources
from ISD 1820 recording module available at:
https://wiki.keyestudio.com/KS0463_keyestudio_ISD1820_Voice_Recording_and_Playback_Module

* API main files:
	- isd1820.c
	- isd1820.h
* Hardware requirements:
	- ISD 1820 recording module.

			ISD1820    |STM32F446RE        |DESCRIPTION
		    -----------------------------------------------------
			VCC        |3.3V               |Power source
			GND        |GND                |Ground.
			FT         |FT (GPIO_Output)   |Feed Through: if HIGH, the microphone drives the speaker directly.
			P-L        |PL (GPIO_Output)   |PLAY-L: Playback level-activated. While HIGH, it plays the audio stored on EEPROM, until it is over.
			P-E        |PE (GPIO_Output)   |PLAY-E: Playback edge-activated. if HIGH, even for a short period, it plays the audio stored entirely
			REC        |REC (GPIO_Output)  |Recording pin. This pin must remain HIGH for the duration of the recording.
			SP+        |       None        |Speaker out.
			SP-        |       None        |Speaker out.

	- STM32F446RET6 64 PINS.
